## 🎮 Project Overview  
**Cartoon Snake** is a fun, colourful snake game built using **Python + Pygame**. With a custom menu, theme & snake colour selection, and a cute UI, it’s designed to look as good as it plays.

---

## 💡 Key Features  
- Choose from background themes and snake colours  
- Three difficulty levels: **Easy**, **Medium**, **Hard**  
- Animated main menu with floating title  
- Snake head with eyes, smooth body movement  
- Wrap-around screen edges — no wall death  
- Game ends only if snake collides with its own body  
- In-game **MENU** button to return to home screen  

---

## 🕹️ How to Play  
- Use the **arrow keys** (↑ ↓ ← →) to move the snake.  
- From the main menu click **START** after selecting your theme, snake colour and difficulty.  
- During gameplay, click the top-right **MENU** button or press **ESC** to go back to the menu.  
- Eat the red food to grow (+10 points).  
- Avoid hitting the snake’s own body — that causes game over.
